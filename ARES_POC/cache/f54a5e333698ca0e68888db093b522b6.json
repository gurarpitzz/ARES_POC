minors in Florida and New York.[13][14] He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019.[15] Barbara Sampson, the New York City medical examiner, controversially ruled that his death was a suicide by hanging.[16] Forensic pathologist Michael Baden has disputed the ruling, and there has been significant public skepticism about the true cause of his death, resulting in conspiracy theories.[17][18] In July 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage to support the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell.[19][20] When the Department of Justice released the footage, approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds of it was missing,[21][22] and the video was found to have been modified despite the FBI's claim that it was raw.[23]
