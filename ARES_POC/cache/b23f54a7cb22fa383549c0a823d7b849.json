been the site of a protracted insurgency since the 1970s, with ethnic Baloch groups accusing the Pakistani government of exploiting the province's natural resources while marginalising local populations.[6] The BLA, designated as a terrorist organisation by Pakistan, the United States, and the European Union, has conducted numerous attacks on security forces and infrastructure projects, including those linked to the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor.[7] Analysts described the 31 January assaults as a retaliatory escalation, marking one of the deadliest days for militants in recent years.[8]  Attacks[edit] The attacks began around 03:00 PKT and spanned at least nine districts, including Quetta, Gwadar, Mastung, Nushki, Pasni, Kharan, and others.[6][9] Militants used guns, grenades, and suicide vests to target police stations, paramilitary outposts, a high-security prison in Quetta, and civilian vehicles.[10] In Quetta, assailants stormed multiple police facilities, leading to prolonged gunbattles.[7] Suicide bombings were reported in Mastung and Nushki, while in Gwadar and Kharan, civilians were among those killed during the clashes.[8] The BLA described the operations as simultaneous strikes on military and administrative targets, with videos released by the group showing female fighters participating.[7] Pakistani officials reported that security forces thwarted most attempts, engaging in clearance operations that lasted into the following day.[9]  Casualties and aftermath[edit] Initial reports varied, but by 1 February, official figures confirmed 15 security personnel and 18 civilians killed, with an unspecified number injured.[6][8] At least 92 militants were killed during the counter-operations, bringing the total death toll to over 120.[10][9]  Reactions[edit] Pakistan's military condemned the attacks as attempts to undermine stability in Balochistan.[9] International responses included statements from Turkey, which expressed condolences and reaffirmed support against terrorism;[11] Qatar, which rejected violence in all forms;[12] and China, which praised Pakistani forces for thwarting the militants.[13]  See also[edit] Insurgency in
